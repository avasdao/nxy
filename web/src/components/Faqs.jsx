            answer:
                `NO. Nxy is an Layer 1+ (add-on), 100% committed to contributing and growing with the Nexa community now and long into the future. ANY and ALL features being built for Nxy are inherently integrated directly into Nexa's Layer 1 after being deployed.`,

            question: 'Is it legal to create my own Economy?',
            answer:
                `YES! Although historically, and usually through threats of VIOLENCE, the Elites have used government to make it very difficult for the People to control their own WEALTH. Nxy now offers you a simple & convenient UI/UX to the superior financial tools that have existed for decades.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'But isnâ€™t file-sharing illegal?',
            answer:
                `NO. Especially NOT when shared by its original content owner. In the Oasis, Creators have the ability to digitally sign & secure ALL of their content, providing the MOST transparent & secure Content Management System (CMS) in the world.`,

        {
            question: 'How is Nxy different from Nexa?',
            answer:
                `The primary goal of the Nxy community is to explore a wider range of ideas and opportunities that extend beyond the Nexa Roadmap, beyond blockchains, and into the broader social financial (#SoFi) world of global economics.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'How can I become an "official" Nxy partner?',
            answer:
                `Contact us with some details about your project and the type of contributions you plan to make during a formal partnership relationship. If/when approved, you'll receive a full Partnership Welcome Guide on contributing directly to the Nxy open source repositories on GitHub.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'How did you get this on the App Store?',
            answer:
                `Nxy comes in many flavors, from several community-based (FOSS) clients to a few fully-licensed & branded editions. We make adjustments for each platform's codebase to comply with the variety of distribution & service guidelines required by our various partners.`,
        },
    ],
    [
        {
            question: 'How much does it cost to get started?',
            answer:
                `Customizing a brand NEW Space will cost a 1st-time user around 1,000 $NXY in service & transaction fees, which is less than 1/100 of a $0.01.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Do I have to worry about any illegal content on my device?',
            answer:
                `(Optional) on-chain filters are well-maintained, and when enabled, provide real-time protection against engaging with prohibited content. In addition, both desktop and mobile users remain 100% in control of the content they opt -in or -out of viewing & storing (i.e. seeding) while exploring the Oasis.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Where is Nxy based?',
            answer:
                `Nxy is a permissionless and decentralized network of Creators, built using a collection of 100% free and open-source software (FOSS) protocols and specifications; and is NOT "controlled" by ANY sole party. However, the "official" Nxy client is built and maintained by Ava's DAO, based in Atlanta Georgia USA.`,
