## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about Nxy.

### Why are you using PoW and not PoS to produce a Space's assets?

Although we're now post "Merge", it is our experience that PoW will offer a greater defense against the ever fearful [__Howey Test__](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp); and give our user community a greater assurance when creating and managing their crypto economies.

### What is 0xNEXA?

__0xNEXA__ is the base coin/asset of Nxy. This coin is bridged from the [__Nexa blockchain__](https://www.nexa.org/) via the [__Nexa Exchange__](https://nexa.exchange). __$NEXA__ is the native coin/asset of Nexa.

_1 0xNEXA = 1 $NEXA_

### What is the USD value of 1 (One) 0xNEXA coin?

At the time of this writing, 0xNEXA has no face value, as there are currently NO exchanges supporting this asset.
