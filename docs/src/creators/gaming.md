Games can be played on your TV, while using your mobile device as a controller. Visit [nexaverse.net](https://nexaverse.net) using your smart TV web browser.

> __You should know! —__ It's highly recommended that all Gaming Spaces use the __Real Money Gaming (RMG)__ blockchain to efficiently & effectively manage all of their counterparty matches.


## Revenue Opportunities

There are ample channels to earn revenue in the Nexaverse:
1. Investor / liquidity pools
2. Token mining
3. Streaming payments

### Investor / Liquidity Pools

For every $1.00 earned by a game:
- 30% is paid to Investors _(aka Liquidity Providers)_
- 60% is paid to the Creators
- 10% is held by the Nexaverse Treasury
